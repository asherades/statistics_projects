## Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects: Compute Statistics from Card Draws, Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

This repository contains files related to two statistics projects. The first project, "Compute Statistics from Card Draws" is a
descriptive statistics project that involved drawing cards from a deck at random, reporting statistics, and making predictions.
The second, "Test a Perceptual Phenomenon", is an inferential statistics project in which I conducted a hypothesis test to analyze 
the Stroop effect, the result of a classic psychological experiment.
